We are a group of two. It was the first time we got down to a project of this type. We haven't had much contact with pixelart or many mechanics that were created by us for the first time. We hope you will have a good time playing and it will compensate for the sleepless nights.

We do not support certain choice points by main character selection issues. The ending vision was created especially for a computer game in relation to the project topic.

Number of chapters: 7
